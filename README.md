Tutorial Source: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world

Since this repository is public. It's a bit shy for me to spread my ideas. Therefore, I decide to take notes about what I've learned so far:
- Terms
    - Nouns
        - Repository
        - Main
            - Think of it as the Final Version of the project
        - Feature
            - The adjustment made alongside the building of the project
        - Commits
            - The saved changes
    - Verbs 
        - Branch
            - To clone the main project that youâ€™re interested in 
            - What you can do:
                - To create a new feature
                - To name the new feature contributed by you
            - Intuitive thinking
                - Allowing good and bad versions of changes to live together.
            - Use case scenario
                - The BRANCHING of the VERSION created
        - Pull in 
            - To check the branches made by other developers
